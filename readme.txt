I had a very hard time with this project because of the makefile aspect. 
Making all of these h and cpp files did cause a bunch of errors. 
Now when you open my hw you will see 3 test files. Test 1 is for the jumbo.
Test 2 for the commuter, and test 3 for the hopper. These files will lead to a
menu of choices of what you can do. I also have these current.dat files that
keep track of the where the economy division is. I did not cout the E or F but
I left the divion because I felt that having that space would show how the two
classes work.
I am having trouble with the switching aircrafts out, but I did want it to
take the number of occupied seats for the flight and display those seats on
another clean copy of whatever aircraft you chose, but that would require
using both string &rw and the vector of seats, which is causing a problem.
Therefore, I am not submitting my version with a function to switch the
aircraft. 

If the changing the rows don't work for making economic it might be because of
a last minute change. However changing first class should work. 

I did try to use a general class as the parent class, but I was getting some
errors so I decided against. 

 Overall, I wanted to make a menu for the user to be able to choose from, and
 in the end i was able to produce that. 

I worked on fa1234.fdf for the jumbo aircraft to base my whole program off of, so
if anything test1 should definitely work. 

However, I did end up running out of time because it said that I had
duplicated the definitions when linking the test1 with the .cpp and .h files. 

Well, I tried my best, so please don't grade too harshly.
Thank you!
